Here are the key points covered in the video:

Transform Pipes:

Used to automatically transform the type of request parameters or query strings.
Examples include parseIntPipe to convert a string to a number and parseBoolPipe to convert a string to a boolean.

Validation with Class Validator and Class Transformer:
Requires creating a DTO (Data Transfer Object) to define the expected structure of the request body.
Class validator decorators are used to enforce validation rules on the DTO properties.
The @UsePipes decorator is used to apply the validation pipe to a controller method.

Custom Validation Pipe:
Can be created to implement specific validation logic.
The pipe should implement the transform method, which takes the value to be transformed and metadata as arguments.
The method can perform validation checks and throw exceptions if the validation fails.

Validation with Zod:
Zod is a library for creating validation schemas.
A Zod validation pipe can be created to perform validation using a Zod schema.
The schema defines the expected structure and validation rules for the request body.
The pipe's transform method uses the schema's parse method to validate the request body and throws a BadRequestException with specific error messages if validation fails.

Key takeaways:
To implement Zod validation:
Create a Zod validation pipe with a schema property.
Implement the transform method to use the schema's parse method and handle validation errors.
Infer the DTO type from the Zod schema using z.infer.
